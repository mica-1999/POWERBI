# Power BI Projects

This repository contains various Power BI reports and dashboards that showcase data visualization and analysis skills. The files here are used for demonstrating different Power BI techniques, creating business intelligence reports, and sharing templates.

## Projects

### 1. Flight
   - 1st little PowerBI project to get to know the tools and all the stuff necessary to do a good representation of data.

### 2. Sodas
   - Putting into practice what I used in the Flight file, this time with variety of sodas in the US.

### 3. MapTesting
   - Doesn't really showcase anything, just a test file to view all of the Map Visualizations available

### 4. Store Sales Report
   - A little more advanced using all the tools that I've learned so far. A new dataset was also provided and I tinkered with it a little bit
   - Layout design turned out to be more clean, probably will be using this design in future projects, also attached some clean UI's I've found.

### 5.1 Equipment Requests SQL (Based on my intership at this time)
   - Boss wanted a clean dashboard that displayed info about the Equipment Requests the company receives
   - Using XAMPP and SQL knowledge to create a sample DB, also using the Stores Sales design, it was possible to achieve what the Boss wanted

### 5.2 Equipment Requests
   - Boss gave me the excel sheet with the data he uses to see the Equipment Request details
   - Changed a couple things from the DAX and Visualizations and it turned into a quite decent looking Dashboard that he can use.
   - Awaiting for futher feedback to see if more changes are needed
